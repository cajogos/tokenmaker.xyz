# How to create your own ERC20 Token on Ethereum

Follow this tutorial on how to create your own ERC20 token on the Ethereum network using this website.

## Requirements

The following is a list of requirements that you must meet before you are able to create your very own cryptocurrency.

- You must have a MetaMask wallet with the extension installed in your browser.
- You must have some ETH in your wallet in order to cover the transaction fees.
  - You are advised to first deploy your token on a testnet (such as Ropsten) until you are completely happy with the result.
  - You can get test ETH for free from a faucet for the network you are currently using.
- You must agree that any token created using this tool is of your own responsibility and liability. This website is only used as a tool to create your token - the supply will be completely moved to your own personal wallet.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install MetaMask

- You must first install MetaMask in your browser.
- The tool does not currently support Mobile wallets or any other wallet providers - perhaps in the future.

### 2. Connect to your Wallet

- Once you have installed MetaMask you need to connect to your wallet.
- Do this by pressing the "Connect Wallet" on the header of the website.
- You have to allow for this website to connect and use your MetaMask information - this is completely safe and is only used to inform you of the currently selected account and network.

### 3. Choose your account and network

- You must be careful when choosing the account and network. This is however going to be displayed at all stages of the deployment process before you commit to pay for the contract deployment.
- If you just want to test creating a contract: choose a testnet network and an account with test ETH.
  - You can get some test ETH by using a Faucet.

### 4. Enter your ERC20 Token Details

- Enter the details for your token:
  - Enter a suitable name for your token. Try to be clear and professional as this will be visible by any of your token holders.
  - Enter a symbol for your token. This will always be in capitals and it is recommended for it to not be longer than 5 characters and to not start with a number.
  - Enter the total supply of your token. This total number of tokens will be sent directly to your wallet once it's deployed.
- Once you are happy with your token details hit "Confirm".

### 5. Deploy your new token

- Once your contract compiles you will be presented with some technical information about your token. This is for debugging purposes and it can usually be dismissed.
- Confirm you are using the correct account and network in your MetaMask wallet.
- Press the "Deploy Contract" button and confirm the transaction fees for contract creation in your MetaMask walet.
- Wait a few minutes for the contract to be deployed.
  - Based on network congestion this can take a few minutes - check your MetaMask wallet for status of the deployment. It should say "Pending".
- Once the contract is deployed you will be presented with the contract address and a "Add to Wallet" button to easily add the token to your MetaMask walet.
- If you use one of the public testnets you should also be able to see the new token information on Etherscan.

### 6. Send tokens to anyone

- Once the token is deployed you can now add it to your MetaMask wallet and send it around to anyone with an Ethereum address.
- Make sure to give them the token address so that it displays on their wallets too.
- Be careful that this also costs ETH gas fees - it is recommended you plan ahead and buy a substantial amount of ETH before you run an airdrop.
