  1. Create a connection to Metamask wallet. (wallet connect)
  2. Created Solidity contracts and deployed them to the Ethereum blockchain. (token-deploy-test)
  3. Implemented a solidity compiler in JavaScript. (solidity-compiler)
- Considerable Improvements:
  1. Usage of import statements in Solidity contracts (adhere to best practices)
  2. Implementation of other types of ERC20 (mintable, burnable, etc)
